## Task Definition
Given a set of exclusively anomaly-free 3D scans of an object, the task is to detect and localize various types of anomalies

## Dataset Intro

the first comprehensive dataset for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization in three-dimensional data. It consists of 4147 highresolution 3D point cloud scans from 10 real-world object categories. While the training and validation sets only contain anomaly-free data, the samples in the test set contain various types of anomalies. Precise ground truth annotations are provided for each anomaly.

## Dataset Description
* Five of the object categories in our dataset exhibit **considerable natural variations from sample to sample**. These are bagel, carrot, cookie, peach, and potato.
* Three more objects, foam, rope, and tire, have **a standardized appearance but can be easily deformed**. 
* The two remaining objects, cable gland and dowel, are **rigid**.
